## Global Variables Declaration

- `firstCandleOpen` - Variable to store the opening time of the first candle
- `highRange`, `lowRange` - Variables to store the high and low range of the opening range
- `tradeExecuted` - Flag to check if a trade has already been executed

## Expert Advisor Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called during the initialization of the expert advisor. It sets the opening time of the first candle by retrieving the time of the current candle using the `iTime()` function.

## Expert Advisor Execution Function

The `OnTick()` function is called for every tick received by the expert advisor. It checks if the current candle is the first candle of the trading day by comparing the time of the current candle with the opening time of the first candle.

If it is the first candle, the function calculates the high and low range of the opening range by retrieving the high and low prices using the `iHigh()` and `iLow()` functions.

Next, it loops through the next 15 minutes to find the highest and lowest prices within the opening range. If a higher price is found, it updates the `highRange` variable, and if a lower price is found, it updates the `lowRange` variable.

Finally, it checks if the current price breaks above the high range or below the low range. If a trade has not been executed yet (`tradeExecuted` is false), it sends a buy or sell order using the `OrderSend()` function based on the breakout direction.

## Expert Advisor Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is deinitialized. It is used to reset the global variables to their initial values.
